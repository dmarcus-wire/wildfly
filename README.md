# Extending jboss-base image from Docker Hub and ultimately deploying to OpenShift

I was recently going through an exercise starting with a base container image from DockerHub, extending/customizing it locally on my RHEL server in a Containerfile and deploying it on my Single Node OpenShift (SNO). I figured I would publish the steps here, since it this shows how to locally develop and run containers using RHEL user interface and terminal and deploying to OpenShift using multiple methods.
